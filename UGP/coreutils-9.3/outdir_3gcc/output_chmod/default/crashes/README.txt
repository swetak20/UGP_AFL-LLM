Command line used to find this crash:

../../AFLplusplus/afl-fuzz -V 600 -i ../test_chmod/indir/ -o ../outdir_3gcc/output_chmod ./chmod.out

If you can't reproduce a bug outside of afl-fuzz, be sure to set the same
memory limit. The limit used for this fuzzing session was 0 B.

Need a tool to minimize test cases before investigating the crashes or sending
them to a vendor? Check out the afl-tmin that comes with the fuzzer!

Found any cool bugs in open-source tools using afl-fuzz? If yes, please post
to https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/issues/286 once the issues
